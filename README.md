## Summary
[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is a crowdfunding service and has rained over $2 billion. However, only a third of more than 300 000 projects that have been launched by Kickstarter passed the funding process successfully.

## Scope
I took an excel datasheet consisting of 4,000+ past projects to organize and analyze some market trends to uncover what makes a project successful or unsuccessful. 

For starters, the project state was color coded for easier differentiation among the different states of the projects.

Pivot tables were used to take the data and present it in different graphs to summarize the findings.

Conclusions may be found in StarterBook Conclusions word document.

Original dataset can be found listed as [StarterBook.xlsx](https://github.com/carmelamonis/excel-challenge/blob/main/StarterBook.xlsx)
